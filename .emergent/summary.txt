The AI engineer's work on the Neon Trader V7 application began with understanding a detailed product document in Arabic, which initially conflicted with the very basic codebase. After clarifying with the user to build from scratch and for real, the engineer progressively constructed a full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application. The development focused on incrementally adding features like a multi-page frontend with Dark Glassy theme and RTL support, a backend with simulated paper trading, real market data integration (Binance), AI-driven daily plans, and comprehensive trading functionalities (multi-asset support). Significant effort was made to refine the UI, implement responsive design, and address user feedback regarding navigation, text overflow, and the distinction between a temporary Power lock and full Logout. The process shifted dramatically when user-provided security reports highlighted critical vulnerabilities (e.g., plaintext password storage in frontend, lack of API authentication). The AI engineer acknowledged these and is currently undertaking a crucial security overhaul, starting with a JWT-based authentication system.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to build Neon Trader V7, an AI-driven automated trading application acting as a personal trading manager. It must provide a comprehensive daily plan, trading opportunities with explanations, and require user approval before execution. It needs to support crypto, forex, and stocks via a unified interface, aiming for stable additional income with human control and transparency.

**Key features outlined in the initial document and implemented:**
- **UI Pages**: Home (performance chart, daily PnL, open/closed trades), Platforms (add/list platforms, connection test, activate trading, security alert), AI Assistant (welcome, daily plan, confidence recommendations, view details planned, approval before execution, voice support planned), Settings (account/security, platform management, trading/risk, AI, logs/notifications, updates/backup, vault import/export, appearance: Dark Glassy, Tajawal font, RTL).
- **Design**: Dark Glassy theme (transparent, blue/purple), Tajawal font (RTL), Mobile-First, prominent daily PnL.
- **Core Engine**: Initial market BTCUSDT (5m), Donchian Breakout tactic (in progress), risk management (0.5% risk, 2% daily loss limit), Meta-Controller (not started), Paper Trading (completed), Testnet/Live (not started).
- **Security**: Encrypted Vault (not implemented), Trade-only keys (UI warning only), Auto-Lock/Session Timeout (partially implemented), Go-Live Checklist (not started).
- **Later User Requests**:
    - **Navigation**: Vertical navigation for desktop, horizontal for mobile, fixing text overflow.
    - **Trading**: Real trading capabilities (not just paper), support for all asset types (Forex, Stocks, Commodities, Indices).
    - **Security**: Distinct Power button for temporary lock vs. full Logout, 2FA, session timeout, auto-lock.
    - **New Features**: Dedicated section for Trading Tools (technical analysis, Japanese candlesticks), Smart Notifications linked to AI Assistant for market alerts, long/medium-term trade advice, and asset purchase recommendations.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Context API (for global state), React Router.
- **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn, Motor (MongoDB ODM), Pydantic, python-dotenv,  (for LLM), ,  (for real trading).
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **AI**: Emergent LLM Key.
- **Security (Planned/Started)**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application file. It contains all backend logic, including API endpoints for portfolio, trades, platforms, AI analysis, daily plans, market data, and smart notifications. It interacts with MongoDB (via Motor) and integrates with  for LLM and  for trading.
    -   *Changes*: Initially minimal, it was heavily expanded to include all core functionalities, real trading integrations, market data fetching, AI services, and recently updated to begin implementing JWT-based authentication.
-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   *Changes*: Updated to include To use the fastapi command, please install "fastapi[standard]":

	pip install "fastapi[standard]", , , , , , , , and ,  for JWT.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Environment variables for the backend.
    -   *Importance*: Crucial for database connection (, ), CORS configuration (), and placeholder for .
    -   *Changes*: Initial placeholders. The  was hardcoded in  and is slated to be moved here.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: The main React component, acting as the entry point and handling global state, routing, and authentication flow.
    -   *Changes*: Significantly modified to integrate ,  for global state, , , , , and dynamically render pages. It also includes toast notifications and handles UI-wide effects.
-   **/app/frontend/src/index.js**: Entry point for the React application.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css & index.css**: Global and component-specific styles, heavily using Tailwind CSS for the Dark Glassy theme and RTL support.
    -   *Changes*: Updated for Tajawal font, Dark Glassy theme, RTL, and responsiveness. Specific fixes for text overflow and navigation styling.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/{Home, Platforms, Assistant, Settings, TradingTools, SmartNotifications}.js**: These files implement the main pages of the application.
    -   *Changes*: Created from scratch.  displays portfolio, charts, quick trading.  manages trading platform connections.  shows AI plans/recommendations.  handles various app configurations.  and  were recently added to the navigation and include AI-driven features.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/{Navigation, Header, Login, SessionManager, UnlockScreen}.js**: Core UI and security components.
    -   *Changes*:  implemented for responsive vertical/horizontal navigation.  contains user info and logout/lock buttons. , ,  were created to handle user authentication (master password, 2FA) and session management (auto-lock, session timeout).
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Environment variables for the frontend.
    -   *Importance*: Crucial for specifying the backend URL ().

<pending_tasks>
- **Complete Security Overhaul**: Implement JWT-based authentication (login, registration, token issuance, verification) in the backend.
- **API Authorization**: Ensure all API endpoints in the backend require authentication and validate  against the authenticated token.
- **Secrets Management**: Move  and other secrets from hardcoded values to backend  variables.
- **Backend Refactoring**: Split the monolithic  into modular components (e.g., , , ).
- **Platform Management Enhancement**: Implement real platform connection testing, and add UI/API for editing and deleting platforms.
- **Portfolio Data Calculation**: Create real functions to calculate and display portfolio data in the  page.
- **Frontend Integration**: Fully integrate the backend security changes into the frontend.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a comprehensive security overhaul for the Neon Trader V7 application, based on critical feedback from user-provided reports. Before this, the application had already achieved significant functionality:
-   A full-stack React/FastAPI application with MongoDB.
-   A responsive frontend with Dark Glassy theme, RTL support, and Tajawal font across multiple pages (Home, Platforms, Assistant, Settings, Trading Tools, Smart Notifications).
-   A backend supporting paper trading, real-time market data (Binance API), AI-driven daily plans, and multi-asset trading (crypto, forex, stocks, commodities, indices).
-   UI improvements including dynamic vertical/horizontal navigation, fixing text overflow, and interactive charts.
-   An initial, albeit vulnerable, security system in the frontend, featuring a master password, 2FA, session manager with auto-lock, session timeout, and a distinct Power button for temporary lock.

The immediate focus has shifted to addressing critical security vulnerabilities. The engineer has just begun implementing a secure JWT-based authentication system in the backend. This involves updating  and  to include libraries like  and  for password hashing and JWT handling. The previous frontend-centric, -based authentication mechanism is being replaced by a robust, backend-driven approach. This is the starting point for fixing the identified critical security issues, such as hardcoded API keys and lack of proper API authentication/authorization.
